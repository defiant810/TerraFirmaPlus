##Contributing
If you wish to contribute to the project, please see the sections below before forking the project and submitting pull requests. Also, I am a stickler for formatting so please make sure you use proper formatting in your code before you submit a pull request. Inproper formatting will get your PR automatically rejected, and frankly makes me want to cry. See the existing code for "proper" formatting techniques.
####Bug Fixes
If you see a bug in the code or broken behavior, feel free to submit a pull request to fix the bug.
####New Features
If you wish to add a new feature to the project or change the way an existing feature works, please contact defiant810 with the details of the feature you want to add, before submitting the pull request.



##Reporting Issues
* If you see an issue or run across a bug, please report it to us using the great issue tracker supplied by Github.
* The reporting system is for bugs only, please do not use it to submit general questions.
* Please include the version of the mod you are using in the issue report, as well as the version of Forge and TFC, and any other mods you may be using.
* Issues regarding ANYTHING that has to do with Optifine will be regarded with extreme skepticism. Optifine is known not to play nice with certain things, so we appreciate if you remove Optifine before submitting the issue. TFC seems to work best with the Standard version of Optifine.
* If you are a coder yourself, and realize that the bug can be easily fixed without getting us involved, by all means please fix it and submit a PR, we appreciate the help.
